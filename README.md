- **Modular Stylesheets:** Break down large stylesheets into smaller, modular files (e.g., `_variables.scss`, `_mixins.scss`, `_components.scss`) and import them as needed.

## TypeScript Practices

- **Enable Strict Type-Checking:** Set `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` for comprehensive type-checking.
- **Avoid `any` Type:** Use precise types or generics instead of the `any` type to maintain type safety.
- **Explicit Typing:** Always specify return types for functions and types for parameters to enhance clarity and maintainability.
- **Interface Naming Conventions:** Prefix interfaces with an uppercase 'I' (e.g., `IUser`) and suffix interface files with `.interface.ts` (e.g., `user.interface.ts`).
- **Leverage ES6 Features:** Utilize arrow functions, modules, and destructuring for cleaner and more modern code.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Maintain uniform naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes to ensure readability.
- **Import Management:** Regularly organize and remove unused imports to keep the codebase tidy.
- **Encapsulation with Private Fields:** Use hard private fields (prefixed with `#`) in classes to enforce encapsulation.
- **Immutability:** Treat objects, arguments, and data structures as immutable by default. Mark function arguments as `readonly` where possible to prevent mutations. Apply `readonly` recursively to nested structures.
- **Utility Types:** Use utility types where appropriate to enhance type safety and reduce redundancy.
- **Hard Privates:** Enforce strict access controls within classes using hard private fields.

## Angular Practices

- **File Separation:** Keep HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript in separate files to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- **Self-Closing Tags:** Use self-closing tags for Angular components without content to reduce markup verbosity.

  - **Presentation Layer:** Manages user interactions and interfaces.
  - **Infrastructure Layer:** Deals with external concerns like databases and file systems.
  
- **Dependency Rule:**
  - Inner layers should not depend on outer layers; dependencies should point inward.
