## CSS and SCSS Practices

- **Utilize Latest Features:** Leverage the latest CSS and SCSS features to write clean, maintainable, and efficient styles.
- **SCSS Nesting:** Use SCSS nesting judiciously to organize styles logically and reduce redundancy without over-nesting, which can lead to specificity issues. Aim for a maximum nesting depth of 3 levels.
- **Style Encapsulation in Angular:** In Angular applications, place style variables within the :host block of the component's CSS to encapsulate styles effectively.
- **CSS Variables:** Use CSS variables for shared properties like colors, spacing, and typography instead of hard-coded values. Define these variables within :host to ensure encapsulation and reusability.
- **Descriptive Color Naming:** Name all colors descriptively (e.g., --color-primary, --color-secondary).
- **Grouped Variables:** Organize variables by category (e.g., colors, spacing, typography) for better organization and maintainability.
- **BEM Naming Convention:** Organize styles using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization:** Avoid unnecessary selectors and reduce specificity to optimize performance and prevent style conflicts.
- **Reusable Styles:** Define extendable styles using %placeholders in SCSS for reuse across components, adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **Avoid Code Comments:** Refrain from adding code comments within CSS and SCSS files; rely on clear naming conventions and structured code to convey intent.
- **Consistent Structure:** Maintain a consistent and logical structure in stylesheets to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design principles using media queries to ensure styles adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds, provide clear focus indicators for interactive elements, and use techniques to include content for screen readers without displaying it visually.
- **Modular Stylesheets:** Break down large stylesheets into smaller, modular files (e.g., _variables.scss, _mixins.scss, _components.scss) and import them as needed to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## TypeScript Practices

- **Enable Strict Type-Checking:** Set "strict": true in tsconfig.json for comprehensive type-checking.
- **Avoid any Type:** Use precise types or generics instead of the any type to maintain type safety.
- **Explicit Typing:** Always specify return types for functions and types for parameters to enhance clarity and maintainability.
- **Interface Naming Conventions:** Prefix interfaces with an uppercase 'I' (e.g., IUser) and suffix interface files with .interface.ts (e.g., user.interface.ts).
- **Leverage ES6 Features:** Utilize arrow functions, modules, and destructuring for cleaner and more modern code.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Maintain uniform naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes to ensure readability.
- **Import Management:** Regularly organize and remove unused imports to keep the codebase tidy.
- **Encapsulation with Private Fields:** Use hard private fields (prefixed with #) in classes to enforce encapsulation.
- **Immutability:** Treat objects, arguments, and data structures as immutable by default. Mark function arguments as readonly where possible to prevent mutations. Apply readonly recursively to nested objects and arrays to
- Must use utility types where possible if it makes sense. 
- Must use hard privates

## Angular Practices

- **File Separation:** Keep HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript in separate files to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- **Self-Closing Tags:** Must use self-closing tags for Angular components without content to reduce markup verbosity. Important: When a component contains content, use standard opening and closing tags.
- **Semantic HTML:** Prefer semantic HTML elements over <div> tags; use <div> sparingly to enhance readability and accessibility.
- **Accessibility Best Practices:**
  - Incorporate appropriate ARIA attributes and roles.
  - Ensure keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.
- **Organized Code Structure:** Maintain a clean and well-organized code structure adhering to the latest Angular coding standards.
- **Logic Separation:** Keep complex logic out of HTML templates; use TypeScript to handle logic, promoting maintainability and testability.
- **Performance Enhancements:**
  - **Lazy Loading:** Favor lazy loading for modules and components to enhance performance by reducing initial load times.
  - **Deferred Rendering:** Implement deferred rendering to dynamically inject presentations, improving responsiveness.
  - **Change Detection Strategy:** Must use the OnPush change detection strategy where possible to optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary checks.
  - **Optimized Data Handling:** Make the code as performant as possible by avoiding redundant operations and optimizing data handling.
- **Advanced Configurations:** Utilize advanced Angular configurations for building applications, leveraging features like environment-specific settings and build optimizations.
- **Dependency Management:**
  - Scope dependencies at the component level or appropriately.
  - Avoid providing services in the root unless necessary to prevent unnecessary memory usage.
- **Signal Inputs:** Use signal inputs for components to manage data flow efficiently and reactively.
- **Access Modifiers:** Prefer protected access modifiers over public where applicable to encapsulate component internals.
- **Avoid Using IDs in Templates:** Refrain from creating IDs on elements to prevent potential conflicts and promote reusable components. Use classes or Angular's template references instead.
- **Appropriate ARIA Attributes and Roles:** Incorporate necessary ARIA attributes and roles to enhance accessibility.
- **Avoid Redundant ARIA Roles:** Do not add ARIA roles to semantic HTML elements that already imply them.
- **Use Angular 19 Input Decorators:** Use Angular 19’s input.required<T>() or input<T>() decorators for all component inputs instead of the traditional @Input() decorator. Make the readonly by default. Favor immutability.
- **Reactive State Management:** Utilize Angular 19’s enhanced reactive state management APIs to handle complex state scenarios more efficiently.
- **Standalone Components:** Embrace Angular 19’s standalone components feature to reduce module dependencies and simplify component usage.
- **Enhanced Signals Integration:** Leverage Angular 19’s improved signals integration for more granular and efficient change detection.
- **Typed Forms:** Use Angular 19’s typed reactive forms to enhance type safety and reduce runtime errors in form handling.
- **Improved Dependency Injection:** Take advantage of Angular 19’s refined dependency injection system for better performance and easier testing.
- **Optimized Template Syntax:** Adopt Angular 19’s optimized template syntax features for cleaner and more maintainable templates.
- **Dynamic Component Loading:** Must Utilize Angular 19’s enhanced dynamic component loading capabilities to improve application scalability and performance only if it makes sense.
- **Advanced Compiler Options:** Configure Angular 19’s advanced compiler options to optimize build sizes and runtime performance.
- **Enhanced Type Safety:** Make use of Angular 19’s enhanced type safety features across the application to minimize type-related errors.
- **Modular Routing:** Implement Angular 19’s modular routing strategies to streamline navigation and improve lazy loading configurations.
- **Favor Deferred View:** Find ways to use deferred views where it makes sense to improve performance and user experience.
- Use Angular 19 syntax

## Clean Architecture with CQRS

- **Layered Structure**:
  - **Domain Layer**: Contains core business logic and entities.
  - **Application Layer**: Handles use cases and application logic, implementing CQRS by separating commands (write operations) and queries (read operations).
  - **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interactions and interfaces.
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Deals with external concerns like databases and file systems.

- **Dependency Rule**:
  - Inner layers should not depend on outer layers; dependencies should point inward.

## Design Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

- **Factory**: Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
