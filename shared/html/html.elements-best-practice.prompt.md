# HTML Element Generation Ruleset for AI Agents: Semantic, Accessible & Maintainable Markup (Non-Deprecated Elements)

**Objective:** To provide a concise ruleset for AI agents to generate *semantically correct*, *accessible*, *well-structured*, *performant*, and *maintainable* HTML markup, focusing exclusively on non-deprecated HTML elements. Adhere to these guidelines for every HTML document and element generated.

**I. Semantic HTML Structure Rules (Core Principles):**

1.  **Use Semantic Elements for Content Meaning:** **ALWAYS prioritize using semantic HTML5 elements that accurately describe the *meaning* and *purpose* of the content.** Choose elements based on their semantic role, not just for visual styling purposes.  **Rationale:** Semantic HTML is crucial for accessibility, SEO, maintainability, and overall web document understanding by both browsers and assistive technologies.

2.  **Structure Content with Semantic Sections:** **UTILIZE semantic sectioning elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to define the logical structure of the document and its content.** Use these elements to delineate distinct content areas and improve document outline. **Rationale:** Semantic sectioning creates a meaningful document outline, improving accessibility for screen reader users and document organization for developers.

3.  **Heading Hierarchy for Content Structure:** **EMPLOY heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a clear and logical heading hierarchy that reflects the content's structure and importance.** Use `<h1>` for the most important heading (typically page title), and progressively lower heading levels for sub-sections and sub-topics.  **Rationale:** Proper heading hierarchy is vital for accessibility, SEO, and document readability. It provides structure and outlines content importance for users and search engines.

4.  **Paragraphs for Text Content Blocks:** **USE `<p>` (paragraph) elements to wrap blocks of standard text content.** Paragraph elements define natural text paragraphs, aiding readability and semantic structure. **Rationale:** `<p>` elements are the semantic element for representing paragraphs of text, essential for clear text presentation and structure.

5.  **Lists for Sets of Items:** **USE semantic list elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) appropriately for presenting *lists* of items.** (Refer to CSS List & Counter Rules for detailed list type selection - Rule 1). Do not misuse list elements for non-list content. **Rationale:**  Semantic list elements (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) correctly convey list structure to browsers and assistive technologies, essential for accessibility of lists.

6.  **Figures and Captions for Media:** **USE `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements to semantically group media content (images, videos, diagrams, etc.) with their captions.**  `<figure>` represents self-contained content, and `<figcaption>` provides a caption for the figure content. **Rationale:** `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` semantically link media content with their descriptions, improving accessibility and organization for media elements.

**II. Accessibility Rules for HTML Elements:**

7.  **Accessible Forms - Labels, ARIA (when needed):** **CREATE accessible forms by ALWAYS associating form controls (`<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`) with `<label>` elements using the `for` attribute.**  For complex form structures or dynamic interactions, use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-required`) to enhance form accessibility when semantic HTML is insufficient. **Rationale:** `<label>` elements are crucial for form accessibility, linking labels to form controls for screen reader users. ARIA provides additional accessibility semantics for complex form scenarios.

8.  **Accessible Images - `alt` Attribute for Alternative Text:** **ALWAYS provide meaningful `alt` text for `<img>` elements using the `alt` attribute.**  `alt` text should describe the *content* and *function* of the image for users who cannot see it (screen reader users, users with images disabled). For purely decorative images, use `alt=""` (empty alt attribute) or consider CSS background images instead. **Rationale:** `alt` text is essential for image accessibility, providing textual alternatives for images for screen reader users and SEO.

9.  **Accessible Links - Meaningful Link Text:** **WRITE CLEAR and MEANINGFUL link text for `<a>` (anchor) elements.** Link text should accurately describe the *destination* and *purpose* of the link. Avoid generic link text like "click here." Ensure links are visually distinct and keyboard focusable. **Rationale:** Meaningful link text is crucial for accessibility, allowing users to understand link destinations from the link text itself.

10. **Accessible Tables - Semantic Table Structure & Captions:** **STRUCTURE tables semantically using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements.** Use `<caption>` to provide a table title/summary for screen readers. Use `<th>` for table headers, and scope attributes (`scope="col"`, `scope="row"`) for complex tables to associate headers correctly. **Rationale:** Semantic table structure ensures tables are accessible to screen reader users, allowing them to navigate and understand tabular data effectively.

11.  **Accessible Media - `<audio>` and `<video>` with Controls & Text Alternatives:** **WHEN embedding `<audio>` or `<video>` elements, ALWAYS include `controls` attribute to provide built-in browser controls for playback.** For `<video>`, provide captions or transcripts for accessibility. For `<audio`>, provide transcripts if the audio content is essential. Consider `<track>` element for captions. **Rationale:** `controls` attribute makes media interactive for all users. Captions and transcripts are vital for making audio and video content accessible to users with hearing impairments.

12. **Use ARIA Responsibly & Only When Necessary:** **USE ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility ONLY when semantic HTML alone is *insufficient* to convey accessibility information.**  Do not overuse ARIA or use it to "fix" poorly semantic HTML structure. Prioritize semantic HTML first. Use ARIA judiciously for dynamic content, complex UI widgets, and roles/states not inherently represented in HTML. **Rationale:** ARIA is a powerful tool but should be used as a *supplement* to semantic HTML, not a replacement. Overuse or misuse of ARIA can create accessibility issues.

**III. Structure & Hierarchy Rules (Document Outline & Code Organization):**

13. **Logical Document Outline - Consistent Heading Levels:** **MAINTAIN a logical and consistent heading level structure (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) throughout the document to create a clear document outline.** Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h1>` to `<h3>` without an `<h2>`). Nest sections and headings logically to reflect content hierarchy. **Rationale:**  A well-formed heading outline is essential for document organization and accessibility. Consistent heading levels create a predictable and understandable document structure.

14. **Clean and Consistent HTML Indentation:** **INDENT HTML code consistently to reflect nesting structure.** Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces or tabs) for readability and visual code organization. **Rationale:** Proper indentation significantly improves HTML code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand the document structure at a glance.

15. **Minimize Deep Nesting (Maintain DOM Tree Depth):** **AVOID overly deep nesting of HTML elements, especially for layout purposes.**  Deeply nested DOM structures can impact performance and maintainability.  Aim for a relatively flat and semantic DOM tree. **Rationale:**  Deeply nested DOM trees can increase browser processing and potentially impact performance. Keeping the DOM reasonably flat improves efficiency and maintainability.

16. **Group Related Content Logically:** **GROUP semantically related HTML elements together using appropriate container elements (`<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.).**  Group content logically to reflect semantic relationships within the document. **Rationale:** Logical content grouping improves code organization and semantic clarity, making the HTML structure more meaningful.

17. **Use Comments Judiciously (for complex or non-obvious markup):** **USE HTML comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of markup, particularly for complex layouts, ARIA usage, or unusual structural patterns.** Comment where needed to enhance code understanding for other developers (or future AI iterations). **Rationale:** Comments in HTML can aid understanding of complex or less-obvious markup sections, improving maintainability, especially in collaborative or long-term projects.

**IV. Maintainability & Readability Rules:**

18. **Descriptive Class Names (and IDs when appropriate):** **USE descriptive and meaningful CSS class names to style HTML elements.** Class names should indicate the *purpose* or *function* of the element (e.g., `main-navigation`, `product-card`, `error-message`). Use IDs sparingly and primarily for JavaScript interactions or unique element identification (within a page - consider component-based approaches instead of page-level IDs). **Rationale:** Descriptive class names improve CSS and HTML maintainability, making stylesheets and markup easier to understand and modify. Avoid generic or presentational class names.

19. **Consistent HTML Conventions (Naming, Structure):** **ADOPT and MAINTAIN consistent HTML coding conventions throughout a project (e.g., element nesting patterns, attribute order, class naming conventions).**  Consistency improves code readability and maintainability. **Rationale:** Consistent coding style enhances code predictability and reduces cognitive load when reading and modifying HTML across a project.

20. **Validate HTML Markup:** **REGULARLY VALIDATE generated HTML markup using HTML validators (online tools or browser developer tools).** Fix any validation errors to ensure well-formed and valid HTML. **Rationale:** Valid HTML is essential for consistent browser rendering and proper functionality. Validation helps catch errors early in the development process.

**V. Performance Considerations (HTML Structure):**

21. **Minimize DOM Size (Keep HTML Lean):** **GENERATE HTML that is as lean and efficient as possible, avoiding unnecessary or redundant elements and deep nesting.**  Smaller DOM size generally contributes to faster page loading and rendering. **Rationale:** A smaller DOM tree reduces browser processing time, leading to faster page load and improved performance, especially on less powerful devices and slower networks.

22. **Lazy Load Images ( `loading="lazy"` Attribute):** **AUTOMATICALLY add `loading="lazy"` attribute to `<img>` elements that are below-the-fold (not initially visible in the viewport) to enable lazy loading of images.**  This improves initial page load time by deferring image loading until they are needed. **Rationale:** Lazy loading significantly improves page load performance, especially for pages with many images, by loading images only when they are about to become visible, reducing initial bandwidth consumption and render blocking.

23. **Defer or Async JavaScript (Strategic Script Placement):** **PLACE `<script>` tags strategically.**  Use `defer` attribute for scripts that can be executed after HTML parsing but before DOMContentLoaded event. Use `async` for scripts that can be executed independently without blocking parsing. Place non-blocking scripts at the end of the `<body>` to avoid blocking initial rendering. **Rationale:** Strategic script placement and use of `defer` and `async` attributes optimizes page loading by preventing JavaScript execution from blocking HTML parsing and initial rendering.
